# DND-RPG-TEXT-GameDemo
This is a command-line based text adventure game set in a fantasy world filled with magic and monsters. The game is similar in style to the classic Dungeons & Dragons. Players will take on the role of an adventurer exploring a series of interconnected locations, collecting items, battling monsters, and ultimately defeating the final boss. The player's goal is to increase their score by defeating monsters and eventually defeating the boss.

# Basic Game Rules:


# Navigation:

Players can use commands N, S, E, W or the full words North, South, East, West to move between different locations.
Each location will display the currently available exits. If there is no exit in a particular direction, the player will be informed that they cannot move that way.
# Collecting Items:

Players can collect all the items in the current location by typing the collect command.
Use the inventory or inv command to view all items the player is carrying, categorized into weapons, potions, and treasures, sorted alphabetically.
Players can restore their health by typing the drink command, which will consume all healing potions in their inventory.
# Combat:

Players can engage in combat with monsters in the current location by typing the fight command.
Combat is turn-based; the monster attacks first, and then the player counterattacks. Damage dealt by both sides is determined by rolling dice, with the player's weapon influencing their damage. If the player is wearing armor, it can reduce a fixed amount of damage from the monster's attack.
If there are multiple monsters in the location, the player must defeat them one by one.
After defeating a monster, players can collect any items the monster drops to enhance their abilities.
# Game Objective:

Increase your score by exploring different locations and defeating monsters.
In the final stage of the game, the player will encounter the Boss in the "Cave." The game ends when the Boss is defeated.
# Exiting the Game:

Players can quit the game at any time by typing the quit command, which will display their current score.
